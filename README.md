A place to store together a little bit of my drawings, pixel art and another kind of design stuff made by myself. Some of the compositions of pixel art may be made by collage technique and are not pixel objects created by myself, but all are original compositions made by me nonetheless.

This is an experimental repo as I am currently developing my design skills so expect this to evolve over time.

Enjoy and have a nice day! ðŸŒŠ
