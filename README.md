A place to store together a little bit of pixel art and related art made by myself. Some of the compositions may be made by collage technique and are not pixel objects created by myself, but all are original compositions made by my.

This is an experimental repo as I am currently developing my design skills so expect this to evolve over time.

Enjoy and have a nice day! ðŸŒŠ
